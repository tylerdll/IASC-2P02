    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    
    <h2>Tyler De Las Llagas</h2>

<p>
    For this data visualization I have chosen to visualize William Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet 1595. The story follows two star-crossed lovers journey as they explore their forbidden love. The story ends with destruction, death and chaos, one of Shakespeare’s first and arguably most influential love story tragedies. I chose this text as the story is an intricate story with various themes of forbidden love, family feuds, and tragic mistakes that provide a great amount of different inspirations for the visualization. I believe that this play is one of the most well written Shakespeare tragedies and shows great complexity in reading/experiencing it as you want the best for the couple but also, the consequences are monumental. By analyzing the text through the visualization, I aimed to represent certain patterns and meanings behind the play.

    When looking at the visualization it shows Romeo, Juliet, and their love. The hearts represent the feelings that Romeo and Juliet feel towards each other throughout the whole play. As we can see in the visualization, almost every scene that we see them in, the word and overall theme of the whole play of love. 
 In the visualization we see Romeo and Juliet on opposing sides representing their feuding families. Their love is shown to be the thing that connects them but subsequently it is the barrier which keeps them apart. The visualization shows  Romeo and Juliets connection and how strong it is until the end of the play.
Additionally, in several areas the word love lessens when Romeo and Juliet are less involved in the story which could signify that the other characters do not feel or understand the love that the star crossed lovers share. Towards the end of the play, the word love seems to dissipate with it becoming their downfall that leads to their death.

    Instead of the theme of love between the two main characters, the second visualization shows the darker theme and consequences to their love. When people talk about Romeo and Juliet most think about the great love story without knowing what terrible events happen in the story due to the relationship. 
This visualization shows the three words “death” “died” and “slain”.  These terms are all much different than Romeo and Juliet’s love story but are always existent throughout the play.
Additionally, the shapes of the words are shown as bubbles that represent the poisonous potion that Romeo and Juliet ingest at the end of the film. 


	The frequency of the bubbles represent their love turning into darkness and death is shown throughout the whole play. These bubbles are displayed in chronological order (the start being the bottom and end being the top). As we can see, these terms are shown a little at the start but, towards the climax when Romeo and Juliet are finally getting together, the darker themes are shown.The darker themed bubbles all pile up at the top and pop when many characters meet their demise.

    The visualization reveals the theme of tragedy evolves over the course of the play, from the initial foreshadowing of doom to the climax of the end. The colours representing the darkness of the final act of the play and the poison both Romeo and Juliet drink concluding their tragedy. Furthermore, the visualization depicts the tragic mistakes and miscommunications that contribute to escalation towards the end of the play.

    Something I would have liked to do for my data visualization would be to format the shapes into more intricate shapes. I feel like my lack of knowledge towards this project was detrimental and limiting to my creativity. But, nevertheless what I created communicated my thoughts perfectly.I would like to improve on my data visualization by being able to create more freedom with the camera and letting the viewer interact with the data visualization more.
